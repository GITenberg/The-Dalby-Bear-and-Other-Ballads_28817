5</span>THE DALBY BEAR</h2>
<p>There goes a bear on Dalby moors,<br />
Oxen and horses he devours.</p>
<p>The peasants are in deep distress<br />
The laidly bear should them oppress.</p>
<p>Their heads together at length they lay,<br />
How they the bear might seize and slay.</p>
<p>They drove their porkers through the wood,<br />
The bear turn&rsquo;d round as he lay at food.</p>
<p>Outspoke as best he could the bear:<br />
&ldquo;What kind of guests approach my lair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uprose the bear amain from his food,<br />
A christian man before him stood.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>A little hour together they fought,<br />
The bear to the earth the man has brought.</p>
<p>Fast came a knight as he could make,<br />
He heard the heart of the peasant break.</p>
<p>The bear upon him fiercely glar&rsquo;d;<br />
&ldquo;Thou needst not hurry, I&rsquo;m
prepar&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou by me shalt be stoutly met,<br />
So thou may&rsquo;st vapour and thou may&rsquo;st threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hast spear and nimble hand,<br />
I&rsquo;ve claws and teeth at my command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fought for a day, they fought for two,<br />
And so on the third they continu&rsquo;d to do.</p>
<p>But when to night the fourth day drew,<br />
The bear to the earth the warrior threw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt no victory gain from me,<br />
Thou haughty knight, thou may&rsquo;st certain be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I late was the son of a powerful King,<br />
A Queen me into the world did bring.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;My Step-dame chang&rsquo;d me, as you see,<br />
She&rsquo;d ruin me to eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the wild forest I have run,<br />
To the boors much scathe and violence done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In winter and in summer&rsquo;s tide<br />
In peace for me they could not bide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may thank my cruel Dame,<br />
For &rsquo;twas through her I a bear became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She plac&rsquo;d around my neck so tight<br />
An iron band in wrath and spite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou this accursed band canst break<br />
Thy life from thee I will not take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I will help thee from thy thrall;<br />
Maria&rsquo;s son who has power for all</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will loosen from thee this stubborn band,<br />
Full able thereto is his right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er him the cross the knight did make,<br />
The iron burst from the bruin&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>He became a youth as fair as day,<br />
His father&rsquo;s realm he went to sway.</p>
<p>A noble maid awaits the knight,<br />
The hand of the Monarch&rsquo;s sister bright.</p>
<p>They liv&rsquo;d together in honor and joy,<br />
To the cruel Stepdame&rsquo;s great annoy.</p>
<p>A hard flint rock she soon became,<br />
For herself she earn&rsquo;d both woe and shame.</p>

9</span>TYGGE HERMANDSEN</h2>
<p>Down o&rsquo;er the isle in torrents fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a Thursday morn the rain;<br />
To fetch his bride now forth shall ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Tygge Hermandsen.</p>
<p>Sir Tygge out of the window look&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brooks ran boisterously;<br />
&ldquo;To ride out now would bring me woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dear no bride I&rsquo;ll buy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hear thou, Nilaus Benditson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long shanks has thy good steed;<br />
I beg for the love of the God above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll fetch my bride with speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Then answer&rsquo;d Nilaus Benditson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his sleeve thus answer&rsquo;d he:<br />
&ldquo;If me thou dispatch thy bride to fetch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trick thee certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Nilaus Benditson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He rode the bride to meet;<br />
There hung silk sheen and sendal green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before his courser&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>They clad themselves in silken cloth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in cloth of gold beside;<br />
In long array to the Kirk their way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They took with the youthful bride.</p>
<p>The bride before the holy Kirk door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a blooming rose did stand;<br />
Oft did she turn to the water, to learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If the bridegroom was at hand.</p>
<p>Then answer&rsquo;d Nilaus Benditson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood by the bride so close:<br />
&ldquo;The brooks so roar&rsquo;d that to cross the ford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He fear&rsquo;d would wet his hose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>They plac&rsquo;d the bride on the bridal bench<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With pomp and honor high;<br />
Oft would they turn to the water to learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If the bridegroom bold drew nigh.</p>
<p>In the silver cup they skink the ale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the nut-brown mead they pour;<br />
Thus things they sped till day was fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And until of bed the hour.</p>
<p>They lifted up the youthful bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bride-bed her they set;<br />
And there sat she for hours three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There came no bridegroom yet.</p>
<p>The priests before the bride-bed stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sang with all their might:<br />
&ldquo;Who in the bed in the bridegroom&rsquo;s stead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall sleep with the bride tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forth stepp&rsquo;d Nilaus Benditson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His lac&rsquo;d shoe off flung he:<br />
&ldquo;With the bride so bright I&rsquo;ll sleep tonight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give her my troth with glee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>So they the bridal solemnized,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glad themselves they made;<br />
At home was then Tygge Hermandsen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To cross the brooks afraid.</p>
<p>It chanc&rsquo;d upon a Wednesday,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The waters began to fall;<br />
Across came then Tygge Hermandsen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his gay bridesmen all.</p>
<p>And he came to the bridal house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the feast was spread in state,<br />
Then up and cried the youthful bride:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ride back, you come too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, thou beauteous Sidselil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve this to complain of thee,<br />
That thou hast ta&rsquo;en another swain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And broke thy troth with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, thou Tygge Hermandsen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou might&rsquo;st have been aware,<br />
I would disdain to wed the swain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wet his feet had fear.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;If thou hadst been a Lady&rsquo;s swain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hadst thou lov&rsquo;d me true,<br />
With thy sword&rsquo;s stroke thou wouldst have broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy way through the billows blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the cloyster I&rsquo;ll myself betake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the monkish vow I&rsquo;ll swear;<br />
For good or ill, proud Sidselil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never more come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if hereby thy way shall lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the brooks shall calmly run,<br />
If cheeses two in my store I view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In thy sack I&rsquo;ll drop thee one.&rdquo; <a

14</span>THE WICKED STEPMOTHER</h2>
<p>Sir Ove he has no daughter but one,<br />

He bestow&rsquo;d her the Lord of Elling upon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

<p>He bestow&rsquo;d her upon a gallant knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

Sir Stig Cob was the gallant hight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

<p>When a year to end had well nigh come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>.<br

Two sons had Thorelil in her womb.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

But worse and worse her plight became.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they
ride</i>.</p>
<p>Sir Stig his bonnet he has put on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

And into the hall to his mother is gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they
ride</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, dear mother, canst thou rede,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

How it with Thorelil shall speed?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

<p>&ldquo;For forty weeks and a year I trow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

Thy Thorelil with child shall go.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

<p>&ldquo;O mother dear, it can scarce be so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

<p>&ldquo;The horses are grazing upon the moor,<br />

When the horses to the coach were led.<br />

<p>Stig took her so tenderly by the waist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>.<br

<p>And when they came under the green wood bough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>All underneath a green hill&rsquo;s side</i>,<br

Her chariot broke her weight below.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In such peril through the forest they

<p>And when to the castle gate they won,<br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
